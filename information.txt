We were only allowed to code for the backend (Only Flask/Python) Only exception being the last user story.

We had to write automated tests for most user stories. We could choose between PyTest and PostMan when writing tests

We also had to make the Database in SQLite and make our own Database structure. ERD & SQL code for my DB will be given if requested
